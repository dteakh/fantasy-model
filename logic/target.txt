Due to HLTV Fantasy padding system (simplified version):

Features: personal stats + team stats + event info
Modelling targets: expected points gain per game (pts), expected winrate at the event (wr)
Formula for pts: (rating - 1) // 4 for bo1, (rating - 1) // 2 for bo3, 3 * (rating - 1) // 4 for bo5

Player's performance formula: pts + 6 * wr - 3 * (1 - wr) = pts + 9 * wr - 3
Solve the knapsack problem: maximize sum of performances given the constraints
Solve the assignment problem: maximize expectation of role/booster points given activation probabilities
